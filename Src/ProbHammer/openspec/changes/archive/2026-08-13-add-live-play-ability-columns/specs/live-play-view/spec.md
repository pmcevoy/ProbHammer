## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Ability Section Rendering
**Reason**: Replaced by ability columns rendered inline within the Statline area (see "Statline
Ability Column Rendering") — abilities no longer render in a separate combined-list section.
**Migration**: No data migration needed; this is a page-rendering change only. Any test or
integration relying on a standalone "Abilities" section should target the new Model/Unit Abilities
columns within the Statline section instead.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Statline Ability Column Rendering
Each unit block's Statline area SHALL render two additional columns alongside the statline column:
a Model Abilities column for entries whose Ability has Scope Model, and a Unit Abilities column for
entries whose Ability has Scope Unit. Within each column, an ability entry bound to a specific
statline row SHALL render beside that row only; an ability entry with no statline-row binding (a
component-wide ability) SHALL render beside the first rendered statline row belonging to its
component, and SHALL visually span every row belonging to that component. Each ability SHALL
render by Name only; ability descriptive Text is not rendered by this requirement.

#### Scenario: A row-bound ability renders beside its own statline row
- **WHEN** an ability entry carries the name of a specific statline
- **THEN** it renders in its Scope's column beside that specific statline row, not beside any
  other row of the same component

#### Scenario: A component-wide ability spans every row of its component
- **WHEN** an ability entry carries no statline name (a Datasheet-sourced, component-wide ability)
  and its owning component renders three statline rows (e.g. two merged into one shared tile and
  one separate)
- **THEN** it renders once, beside the first of those three rows, visually spanning all three

#### Scenario: Column placement is determined by Ability Scope
- **WHEN** a component contributes both a Model-scoped and a Unit-scoped ability
- **THEN** the Model-scoped ability renders in the Model Abilities column and the Unit-scoped
  ability renders in the Unit Abilities column, regardless of whether either is row-bound or
  component-wide

#### Scenario: Only the ability name renders
- **WHEN** an ability entry renders in either column
- **THEN** only its Name is shown; its descriptive Text is not rendered

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Statline Section Rendering
Each unit block SHALL group the view's `Statlines` into contiguous runs, where consecutive entries
belong to the same run only if they share both the same `ComponentName` and an identical Statline
value (M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc, and InSv when present); an entry whose `ComponentName` or Statline value
differs from its immediate predecessor starts a new run. For each run, the unit block SHALL render
one shared stat-tile showing that run's M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc values (and InSv when present), and SHALL
render one header line per entry in the run — showing that entry's own name and remaining/initial
model count as its own distinct element, never concatenated with another entry's header — above
the shared stat-tile, in the run's order. Each entry's header line SHALL render its own nested
loadout breakdown listing every entry in that statline's `Loadouts`, showing each loadout's weapon
list and its own remaining/initial count, unaffected by whether it is sharing a stat-tile with
other entries. This statline rendering occupies the first of three columns in the unit block's
Statline area — see "Statline Ability Column Rendering" for the other two.

#### Scenario: Squad with a distinct sergeant statline sharing the same values
- **WHEN** a unit's aggregate view contains two consecutive same-component statline entries with
  identical M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc values but different names (e.g. "Sword Brother" and "Initiate", both
  Sv3+ — or "Assault Intercessor Sergeant" and "Assault Intercessor")
- **THEN** the rendered block shows one shared stat-tile with two header lines above it, one per
  name, each showing that entry's own remaining/initial count — this reverses the no-merge
  scenario `live-play-gw-layout` introduced, now that each entry's own name/count/loadouts render
  as independent elements within the shared block rather than being lost to a data-level merge

#### Scenario: Statlines with differing values stay on separate rows
- **WHEN** a unit's aggregate view contains three consecutive same-component statline entries
  where the first two share an identical value and the third has a different value (e.g. Sword
  Brother and Initiate at Sv3+, followed by Neophyte at Sv4+)
- **THEN** the rendered page shows the first two under one shared stat-tile, and Neophyte under its
  own separate stat-tile immediately after

#### Scenario: A component boundary breaks the run even when values match
- **WHEN** an AttachedUnit's last-rendered Attached-unit entry and its first-rendered Bodyguard
  entry are adjacent in the Statlines list and happen to share an identical M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc value
- **THEN** they render under two separate stat-tiles, never combined into one

#### Scenario: A statline with no adjacent value-equal neighbor renders alone
- **WHEN** a statline entry's Statline value differs from both its predecessor's and successor's
  values (or it has none)
- **THEN** it renders as a run of one: its own header line above its own stat-tile, identical in
  appearance to how a single entry rendered before this change

#### Scenario: Loadout breakdown lists every contributing model-line
- **WHEN** a statline entry's `Loadouts` contains two entries with different weapon lists and counts
- **THEN** that entry's header line's nested breakdown shows both, each with its own weapon list and remaining/initial count, regardless of whether the entry is sharing a stat-tile with others

#### Scenario: Single-loadout entry has no redundant breakdown row
- **WHEN** a statline entry's `Loadouts` contains exactly one entry
- **THEN** its header line shows that entry's remaining/initial count and renders no nested
  loadout breakdown, regardless of whether the entry is sharing a stat-tile with others

#### Scenario: Invulnerable save renders when present
- **WHEN** a run's shared Statline value has an `InSv` value set
- **THEN** the rendered stat-tile displays that invulnerable save value

#### Scenario: Invulnerable save is omitted when absent
- **WHEN** a run's shared Statline value has an unset `InSv` value (the default)
- **THEN** the rendered stat-tile does not display an invulnerable save value

### Requirement: Empty Sections Render Without Error
If any of `Statlines`, `Weapons`, the per-component ability data, or `Keywords` is empty for a
given unit, the page SHALL render that unit's block without error, omitting or clearly marking the
empty section or column.

#### Scenario: Unit with no unit-scoped abilities
- **WHEN** a unit's aggregate view has no Unit-scoped ability entries for any of its components
- **THEN** the page renders that unit's block successfully, with no exception and no blank/broken
  markup in the Unit Abilities column

### Requirement: Per-Section Disclosure Defaults to Collapsed
Each unit block's statline (including its two ability columns), ranged-weapons, and melee-weapons
sections SHALL be independently collapsible, and SHALL render collapsed by default when the page
first loads.

#### Scenario: Sections load collapsed
- **WHEN** a user navigates to `/LivePlay`
- **THEN** every unit block's statline, ranged-weapons, and melee-weapons sections render in a
  collapsed state, showing no section's detail content until expanded

#### Scenario: Expanding one section does not affect others
- **WHEN** a user expands one unit's ranged-weapons section
- **THEN** that unit's other sections, and every section of every other unit block, remain in
  their prior collapsed/expanded state
