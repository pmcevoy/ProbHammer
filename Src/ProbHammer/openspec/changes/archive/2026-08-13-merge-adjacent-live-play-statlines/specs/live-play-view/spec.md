## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Statline Section Rendering
Each unit block SHALL group the view's `Statlines` into contiguous runs, where consecutive entries
belong to the same run only if they share both the same `ComponentName` and an identical Statline
value (M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc, and InSv when present); an entry whose `ComponentName` or Statline value
differs from its immediate predecessor starts a new run. For each run, the unit block SHALL render
one shared stat-tile showing that run's M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc values (and InSv when present), and SHALL
render one header line per entry in the run — showing that entry's own name and remaining/initial
model count as its own distinct element, never concatenated with another entry's header — above
the shared stat-tile, in the run's order. Each entry's header line SHALL render its own nested
loadout breakdown listing every entry in that statline's `Loadouts`, showing each loadout's weapon
list and its own remaining/initial count, unaffected by whether it is sharing a stat-tile with
other entries.

#### Scenario: Squad with a distinct sergeant statline sharing the same values
- **WHEN** a unit's aggregate view contains two consecutive same-component statline entries with
  identical M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc values but different names (e.g. "Sword Brother" and "Initiate", both
  Sv3+ — or "Assault Intercessor Sergeant" and "Assault Intercessor")
- **THEN** the rendered block shows one shared stat-tile with two header lines above it, one per
  name, each showing that entry's own remaining/initial count — this reverses the no-merge
  scenario `live-play-gw-layout` introduced, now that each entry's own name/count/loadouts render
  as independent elements within the shared block rather than being lost to a data-level merge

#### Scenario: Statlines with differing values stay on separate rows
- **WHEN** a unit's aggregate view contains three consecutive same-component statline entries
  where the first two share an identical value and the third has a different value (e.g. Sword
  Brother and Initiate at Sv3+, followed by Neophyte at Sv4+)
- **THEN** the rendered page shows the first two under one shared stat-tile, and Neophyte under its
  own separate stat-tile immediately after

#### Scenario: A component boundary breaks the run even when values match
- **WHEN** an AttachedUnit's last-rendered Attached-unit entry and its first-rendered Bodyguard
  entry are adjacent in the Statlines list and happen to share an identical M/T/Sv/W/Ld/Oc value
- **THEN** they render under two separate stat-tiles, never combined into one

#### Scenario: A statline with no adjacent value-equal neighbor renders alone
- **WHEN** a statline entry's Statline value differs from both its predecessor's and successor's
  values (or it has none)
- **THEN** it renders as a run of one: its own header line above its own stat-tile, identical in
  appearance to how a single entry rendered before this change

#### Scenario: Loadout breakdown lists every contributing model-line
- **WHEN** a statline entry's `Loadouts` contains two entries with different weapon lists and counts
- **THEN** that entry's header line's nested breakdown shows both, each with its own weapon list and remaining/initial count, regardless of whether the entry is sharing a stat-tile with others

#### Scenario: Invulnerable save renders when present
- **WHEN** a run's shared Statline value has an `InSv` value set
- **THEN** the rendered stat-tile displays that invulnerable save value

#### Scenario: Invulnerable save is omitted when absent
- **WHEN** a run's shared Statline value has an unset `InSv` value (the default)
- **THEN** the rendered stat-tile does not display an invulnerable save value
